# COSI21A_PA2
You have been hired by an international chess society to update their scoreboard system. The chess society is a membership organization, the members play chess against one another and the society keeps track of the outcomes. Each member has an Elo rating (a score based on their prior performance in chess matches), and the members are ranked based on their Elo ratings. Whenever there is a chess match between two society members, the winner’s score increases and the loser’s score decreases, and the rankings may also change. The society members are very competitive, so they frequently check their own ranking and Elo rating and the rankings and ratings of their opponents.
Your predecessor, who dropped out of data structures class after the first assignment, wrote the old scoreboard code using a linked list with insertion sort. This wasn’t a problem when the society was small, but the society is growing, and members are complaining that it takes too long to look up the rankings and ratings of individual players. Of course, we know that this is because searching for a particular member in a linked list takes O(n) time. You have been instructed by the chess society that these lookups need to be worst case O(log(n)) time or you will be fired. To accomplish this task, you will need to build a self-balancing AVL tree, augmented to allow fast computation of player ranking.
